		<p><strong>Disputes with ChangeUp</strong></p>

		<p>If you are unhappy with ChangeUp, we invite you to let us know so we can try to address the issue. If we are unable to address your concern, then these rules will govern any legal dispute involving ChangeUp and our services:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live.</li>
			<li>Arbitration. You and ChangeUp agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the use of the Site or these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section). Our arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and ChangeUp are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the services in your official capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California.</p>

		<p><strong>Changes to the Terms of Use</strong></p>

		<p>At times, ChangeUp will need to change these terms of Use. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by contacting you through the email registered to ChangeUp and by making a public announcement on the site. After reading the new content, you will be asked to agree with the new Terms of Use to continue to use ChangeUp’s services.</p>

		<p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>

		<p>Please refer to the contact form to contact ChangeUp</p>

		<p><strong>Fees and Payments Policy</strong></p>

		<p>ChangeUp is a company that operates with as much transparencies as possible. We don’t want any “gray area” to exist with regard to how things work on the site. The following document will explain ChangeUp’s payment and fees policy to allow you to be familiar with where every dollar and cent is going.</p>

		<p>There are four destinations to where payment will be allocated:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ChangeUp</li>
			<li>Charity</li>
			<li>Card authorization</li>
			<li>Seller</li>
		</ul>

		<p>ChangeUp will receive 1.5% of every sold item before taxes. This amount will circulate back into ChangeUp to improve website functionality and facilitate ChangeUp’s vision and the services offered.</p>

		<p>A Charity will receive a minimum of 4% of every sold item before taxes. This percentage may change from item to item sold on ChangeUp. The percentage of money going to a Charity is determined by the vendor and assigned to each item the vendor sells. For example, if a vendor is selling clothing, they have the ability to sell a pair of socks with 5% of the item’s sales going to a Charity, while simultaneously selling a t-shirt with 15% of the item’s sales benefiting a Charity. As mentioned before, 4% is the minimum, but we encourage everyone to take advantage of the ability to give more.</p>

		<p>The Card Authorization fee has two parts to it. ChangeUp uses the Stripe application to process all payment methods. Stripe requires a 2.9% fee on every transaction total before taxes, plus an additional $0.30 for every item sold. To organize this in the best possible way, ChangeUp is structuring this payment as follows:
		2.9% + $0.30 per vendor, per transaction.</p>
		<p>By formulating the Stripe fee this way, we ensure that every transaction is equal for every vendor that is using the ChangeUp service.</p>

		<p>And the final transaction goes to the Seller. The Seller will receive the remaining net profit from the transaction. This means that Sellers can retain over 91% of profit from a transaction.</p>

		<p><strong>Buyer policy</strong></p>

		<p>ChangeUp is a place where people can come together to affect the world in a positive way. We want to provide a unique and dynamic shopping experience for buyers, while enabling them to benefit others. The following document illustrates the rights and what is expected of you as a buyer.</p>

		<p>This policy is part of the Terms of Use policy that must also be read and agreed on before using this site.</p>

		<p><strong>ChangeUp’s Limitations as a Venue</strong></p>

		<p>ChangeUp happily provides a platform for users and visitors to find, learn about, and enter into transactions with sellers, everywhere. It is important to understand that ChangeUp is not a party to the actual transactions that occur on the Site. As a buyer, you understand that you are not buying directly from ChangeUp, but from a seller that is using ChangeUp as a platform. ChangeUp does not pre-screen sellers which means that ChangeUp does not guarantee or endorse any items sold through the platform or any content posted on the Site. It must also be understood that each seller on ChangeUp has different methods and processes as a seller.</p>

		<p><strong>Communicating with other ChangeUp Users</strong></p>

		<p>As a buying and selling platform, ChangeUp connects people so that they may engage in conversations about the items or processes for a buyer to purchase and receive their items. Such communication shall not be used for any of the following activities:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Sending unsolicited advertising or promotions, requests for donations, or spam</li>
			<li>Harassing or abusing another user</li>
			<li>Interfering with a transaction or the business of another member</li>
			<ul>
				<li>examples include contacting another user to warn them away from another user or shop, posting in public areas to demonstrate or discuss a dispute with another member or purchasing from a seller for the sole purpose of leaving a negative review.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p>Any use of our platform to harass other users, support or glorify hatred towards or demean other based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender and gender identity, disability or sexual orientation is not allowed and strictly enforced. Help us enforce these policies by reporting any messages that go against these terms.</p>

		<p><strong>Purchasing items on ChangeUp</strong></p>

		<p>When buying an item or product from a seller on ChangeUp’s platform you are not only directly supporting that seller, but also a charity that is partnered with ChangeUp. During the checkout process, you will be able to choose the charity to which your money will go. You will have the option to choose from a number of charities that the seller has chosen to link with when putting their items up for sale.</p>

		<p>Besides this process, each seller will have their own listings, policies, processing times, and payment systems. By making purchase from a seller on ChangeUp you agree that you have read the item description and shop policies if listed, have submitted appropriate payment for item or items purchased, and you have provided accurate shipping information to the seller.</p>

		<p><strong>Reviews for Items</strong></p>

		<p>Reviews are an important aspect of the purchasing process. They enable a buyer to share their experience (both good or not as good) with other prospective buyers. Great sellers are rewarded with great reviews; those sellers whose products or processes need improvements learn exactly what their buyers think they can do better. Reviews are completed by choosing a rating: 1 through 5 stars, and then submitting a written review of the item, process or anything else that pertains to the transaction with the seller. Reviews may be made within 60 days of the date of the transaction. During this timeframe, reviews may be edited or changed. Once the 60 day period has passed, the review will be locked in.</p> 

		<p>By leaving a review, you understand and acknowledge that your review will be publicly displayed on the seller’s listing and review page. Reviews must not contain private information, obscene, racist or harassing language or imagery, medical drug claims, advertising or spam. A review should not be about circumstances beyond the control of the seller (i.e. delivery issues), or ChangeUp, and must not undermine the integrity of the reviewing system. Extortion is prohibited; reviews containing such things as a negative review in attempts to force the seller into proving additional, not agreed upon items are not allowed.</p>

		<p>The US federal Trade Commission deems shilling as a deceptive business practice, it is not allowed on the ChangeUp site. Shilling is the fraudulent inflation of a shop’s reputation by use of an alternate account. We reserve the right to remove reviews that violate this policy or any of the other policies mentioned above.</p>

		<p><strong>Reporting a Problem with an Order or Returning an Item</strong></p>

		<p>As mentioned before, ChangeUp is not a party to the transactions made between a buyer and a seller. Regardless of this fact, Buyers may contact us under the following conditions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>A non-delivered item</li>
			<li>An item or product arrives Not-As-Described</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Each seller has their own return policies. These policies should be outlined in their shop policies or made available to buyers before a purchase is made.</p>
		<p>Please note that not all Sellers accept returns.</p>

		<p><strong>Seller Policy</strong></p>

		<p>ChangeUp is a place where vendors and sellers can sell items, goods and products to buyers from all over the world. Not only are sellers fulfilling the needs and purchasing desires of Buyers, but they are also providing a positive impact. With every sale made on ChangeUp, a partnered charity will benefit from the exchange.</p>

		<p>To ensure that ChangeUp’s platform provides a positive experience for everyone, we ask that you review these terms for Sellers along with the rest of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policies before selling your products through our platform.</p>

		<p>By submitting your products for sale on ChangeUp you are agreeing to these following terms.</p>

		<p><strong>Representing Items and Yourself Honestly</strong></p>

		<p>One of ChangeUp’s core values is transparency. We only allow sellers and vendors onto the Site who present themselves and their items or products honestly. This includes providing honest and accurate information about themselves and their products. Respect for intellectual property is also required. You also agree to not engage in fee avoidance.</p>

		<p><strong>Communicating with other ChangeUp Users</strong></p>

		<p>As a buying and selling platform, ChangeUp enables people to connect in order to engage in conversations about the items or processes for a buyer to purchase and receive their items. The communication must not be used for these activities:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Sending unsolicited advertising or promotions, requests for donations, or spam</li>
			<li>Harassing or abusing another user</li>
			<li>Interfering with a transaction or the business of another member:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>examples include contacting another user to warn them away from another user or shop, posting in public areas to demonstrate or discuss a dispute with another member or purchasing from a seller for the sole purpose of leaving a negative review.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p>Any use of our platform to harass other users, support or glorify hatred towards or demean other based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender and gender identity, disability or sexual orientation is not allowed and strictly enforced. Help us enforce these policies by reporting any messages that go against these terms.</p>

		<p>Sellers may receive a Buyer’s email during the transaction process in order to fulfill the transaction. Any information received of a Buyer must be treated respectfully and only be used in accordance to the transaction process. Any harassment or unsolicited use of this information is prohibited. Please refer to our privacy policy for more information.</p>

		<p><strong>Creating and Uploading Content</strong></p>

		<p>As a Vendor on ChangeUp you are able to create and upload different kinds of content including usernames, listings, messages and reviews. By uploading your content you agree that the content is not abusive, threatening, defamatory or harassing. You agree to not use any obscene or vulgar language. You also agree that you will not violate someone’s privacy or intellectual property rights, or upload false, deceptive or misleading content.</p>

		<p><strong>Providing Great Customer Service</strong></p>

		<p>As a Seller on ChangeUp, you will be held to high standards of customer service. By selling on ChangeUp, you are agreeing to the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Honoring you shipping and processing times. Sellers are obligated to ship an item or otherwise complete a transaction with a buyer in a timely manner.</li>
			<li>Respond to customers in a timely manner</li>
			<li>Honor the commitment you make to your customer either in conversation or stated in any policies you hold as a Seller.</li>
			<li>Resolve disagreements or disputes directly with the buyer. In the event you and the Buyer cannot come to an agreement, ChangeUp can be contacted to help resolve the issue</li>
			<li>If you cannot complete an order, you must contact the buyer to notify them that you are unable to fulfill the order. You must then go through the process of canceling the order.</li>
			<li>If you are unable to complete a transaction, you must notify the Buyer before canceling the order. If the Buyer has already paid for the canceled products, you must issue a refund minus the donation taken. You are encouraged to keep proof of any refunds in the event a dispute arises.</li>
